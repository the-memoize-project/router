 *
 * This file is the main entry point for the TypeScript compiler.
 * It uses references to load type declarations for each module
 * (package) of the library, keeping the structure organized.
 *
 * To add types for a new module, create a declaration file for it
 * (e.g., `packages/my-new-package/types.d.ts`) and add a new
 * reference line here.
